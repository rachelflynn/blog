We have all been bombarded with credit card offers on TV, social media, mailers, and in stores. As a student, I received nearly 5 credit card offers in the mail 

**1. Choose an area of interest.** 

If you're like me and you have a wide range of interests, it is difficult to narrow down the exact program you want to do. 

**2. Search for universities (or specific countries) with similar programs. 

**3. Compare the cost of attending each program.** 

In some countries, the cost of tuition can prevent many people from attending grad school (ahem, I'm looking at you, USA). Some people, including yours truly, choose to go to school outside of the country to save some money. Once I selected a few different universities with programs I liked, I compared the financial aspect of attending each. I looked at a program I really liked in Chicago, but just one year (excluding living costs) reached $40,000. There were TA and scholarship opportunities, but that still was wayyyyy too much for me. I also liked a different program in the UK that would have cost $12,000/year plus living expenses. 

**4. Look into the visa process.** 

Once you decide on a program and a university, I recommend briefly looking into the study visa process. Key items to look for are processing times, where to submit the application, how much it costs, and what documents are required. When I was looking into the University of Cape Town, I joined a Facebook group that assists with South African visa questions and problems. This group was soooo helpful in answering questions and providing previous member experiences. Check social media for similar groups in the country you want to move to! 

**5. Apply to the school and reach out to the international office.**

All schools have different application requirements, but the main thing to look out for is the international student deadline. They more than likely will have an earlier deadline for international applicants so they have time to apply for their study visas. The university may also have an early deadline for scholarships or financial aid as well. Make sure to also check the academic calendar for the year you plan to start because the school may have different timings than you are used to. In South Africa, the academic years usually begin in February since it is in the Southern Hemisphere. I am from the US, so I was used to school starting in August/September and applications due in February/March. Both my admission and scholarship application for international students were due 6 months prior to registration and 3 months before South African applicants. Keep your eyes peeled for these dates so you do not miss the opportunity to apply. 

**6. Gather documents and submit your visa app.** 

**7. Apply for scholarships or financial aid.**

**8. Start planning to move!** 

**9. Catch that flight...**
